<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Robert Lamb. I am from Alexandria, Virginia and I am currently a student majoring in Computer Science at the College of William & Mary and an IT Intern at Horizon Industries, Ltd. I hope to become a software engineer upon graduation. I have a strong passion for coding, and I love learning new things. I have been coding since 2019 when I first began learning Java in my AP Computer Science class. In my freetime, I enjoy playing video games, watching football(Go Commanders!), exercising, playing basketball, and hanging out with my friends.</p>
<p>On campus, I am involved with several organizations. I am my fraternity's Alumni Relations Chair, participated in the GeoLab Education Project, and worked as an intramural sports referee for Campus Recreation. During the year, I also work as a self-employed Math and Computer Science Tutor for several high school students via Zoom.</p>
<p>I have a wide array of technical skills and experience, including Java, Python, C, C++, Y-86 Assembly Language, Android Studio, HTML, Microsoft Office, and LaTeX.</p>
