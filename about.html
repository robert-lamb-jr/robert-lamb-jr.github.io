<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Robert Lamb. I am from Alexandria, Virginia and I am currently a student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science at the College of William & Mary. I hope to become a software engineer upon graduation. I have a strong passion for coding, and I love learning new things. I have been coding since 2019 when I first began learning Java in my AP Computer Science class. In my freetime, I enjoy playing video games, watching football(Go Commanders!), exercising, playing basketball, and hanging out with my friends.</p>
